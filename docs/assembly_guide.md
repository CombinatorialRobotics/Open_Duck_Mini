# Assembly guide

## Requirements : 

You will need : 
- A soldering iron, and basic electronics tools and skills
- X m3 screws (TODO : add the exact number)
- Some wire
- Loctite Threadlocker blue 243

First, we build the robot's skeleton 

## Parts needed : 
- foot_top.stl x2
- foot_side.stl x2
- foot_bottom_tpu.stl x2 (TPU)
- foot_bottom_pla.stl x2
- knee_to_ankle_left_sheet.stl x4
- knee_to_ankle_right_sheet.stl x4
- leg_spacer.stl x4
- left_roll_to_pitch.stl x1
- right_roll_to_pitch.stl x1
- roll_motor_bottom.stl x2
- roll_motor_top.stl x2
- trunk_bottom.stl x1
- trunk_top.stl x1
- neck_left_sheet.stl x1
- neck_right_sheet.stl x1
- head_pitch_to_yaw.stl x1
- head_yaw_to_roll.stl x1
- head_roll_mount.stl x1

> General note : Everytime you screw something in the motors, you want to use a little loctite threadlocker. This will prevent the screws from coming loose due to the vibrations during the operation of the robot. It adds a little time to to the build, but you'll be glad you took the time ;)

## Steps :

### Assemble the trunk

Place the bearings in `trunk_bottom` like so, and insert M3 inserts in these holes

Then assamble `trunk_bottom` and `trunk_top`, and screw them together with 2 `M3x6` screws through these holes

Mount the middle motor like so and screw it with the plastic screws that came with the motors :

Insert `roll_motor_bottom` like this

### Assemble the feet

Both feet are the same. 

First, assemble `foot_bottom_tpu` with `foot_bottom_pla`. Insert M3 inserts in these holes :

And screw the two parts together with two `M3x6` screws.

Then, insert M3 inserts in these holes in `foot_top` here :

And assemble everything like so. Make sure the driver side of the motor is on the `foot_top` part side : 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/197cd9b7-05a6-46ed-9af5-d2def37970c8" alt="1" width="500px" > </td>
    <td> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f532fbcc-100b-4715-96a8-66697e4fda26" alt="1" width="500px" > </td>
   </tr> 
</table>

### Assemble the shins

Insert M3 Inserts in these holes of `leg_spacer` (on both sides. Insert 4 M3 inserts in total) :

Then, first plug the motor cable in the foot's motor, and make it go through the `right_sheet` like so

Then assemble like below:

### Assemble the thighs 

### Assemble the hips

### Mount the IMU

Like this 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8772996d-5906-48fa-8cbe-6b6823982375" alt="1" width="500px" ></td>
    <td> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/172f44c7-c7c6-47f8-894a-14024abd24f4" alt="2" width="500px" ></td>
   </tr> 
</table>
