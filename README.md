# Mini BDX Droid

I'm making a miniature version of the BDX Droid by Disney. It will be about 35 centimeters tall with its legs extended.

This is with a custom walk engine based an [old Rhoban walk](https://github.com/Rhoban/walk_engine/tree/master) and the IK is based on [placo](https://github.com/Rhoban/placo)

If you have a xbox controller, you can control the robot with it in MuJoCo (after installing the package, see Install section):

```bash
$ cd experiments/mujoco
$ python3 mujoco_walk_engine.py -x 
```

Start button to start the walk, left joystick to translate in x/y, right joystick to rotate. By pressing the left trigger, you control the head pitch and yaw with the right joystick, and the head height with the right trigger.

Right now I use the keyboard inputs to tune the walk engine's hyperparameters.

I will start building the robot when I can get my hands on some XL330 servos :)

## CAD 

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a18ff8cc622a533762a3a6f5/w/27ef6089ad5fe9ba396b6036/e/9ce9b71d7a21eb04415b067f

See [this document](docs/prepare_robot.md) for getting from a onshape design to a simulated robot in MuJoCo

## Install 

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

## RL stuff

For now, I my greatest achievement in RL is making a breakdancing robot :) 


https://github.com/apirrone/mini_BDX/assets/6552564/43433948-8dc9-4330-9efd-b5d781792eef

This is a mess right now, I'm new to RL and I am experimenting :)

### There is a known bug with mujoco when trying to render the environment

https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/749

To fix

in `<venv_path>gymnasium/envs/mujoco/mujoco_rendering.py` line 592 change solver_iter to solver_niter

### Train 

```bash
$ python train.py -a <algo> -n <experiment_name> -p <[optional]path_to_pretrained_model>
```

#### To Monitor during training

```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir=logs
```

### Infer

```bash
$ python test.py -a <algo> -p <path_to_model>
```

# TODO

## Design TODO
- Rework the roll/pitch part of the hips, its very ugly right now
  - Reworked a little, still ugly
- Integrate contact sensors in the feet
- Make the head part to link the pitch and yaw
- Make it look cool like a BD-X or a BD-1

# Ideas
- Try to make the action space of the rl algo to be the parameters of the expert walk ? 
  - frequency
  - trunk_pitch
  - trunk_roll
  - trunk_yaw
  - trunk_x_offset
  - step_size_x
  - step_size_y
  - rise_gain
  - swing_gain
- OR make the action space of the rl algo to be the cartesian pose of the feet in the trunk frame?
