# V2 ROADMAP

First make the placo walk work with foot sensors -> This validate the design, the motors are powerful enough and urdf is close to the real thing

## CAD

### Notes :
- Plan mounting holes for aesthetic stuff later ?
- Plan to hide the cables somehow
- Integrate feet contact sensors (switchs, not fsr I think)

### TODO
  - [] Full redesign using feetech motors.
    - [] Select the motors STS3215 or STS3250 ? 5v ? 12 v (if 12v, need to change electronics)
  - [] Export new URDF and MJCF

## Motors modeling

### TODO
- [] BAM motors identification
- [] BAM in Isaac Gym

## Electronics

### Notes

Check what they did for Zeroth https://docs.zeroth.bot/build/bom
Maybe use all their electronics ? It's cheap and powerful apparently. Talk with JX

## Software

### TODO
- [] Cleanup Open Duck mini repo
- [] Add documentation
- [] Integrate v2
- [] V2 in AWD
